# Seeding algorithm PRNG

Correctly seeding pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) is important to ensuring reproducible and good-quality randomness. A common pattern is to reinitialize each algorithmâ€™s PRNG with a unique seed for each processed event.

## UniqueIDGenSvc service

The `UniqueIDGenSvc` Gaudi service can generate unique `size_t` values that can be used as PRNG seeds, based on an event number, run number, and algorithm.

The service can be included in a steering file by:

```python
from Configurables import UniqueIDGenSvc
uidgen_svc = UniqueIDGenSvc()
```

The service can be configured with a central seed from which the unique values will be derived. This seed can be configured with the `Seed` property:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Python
```python
uidgen_svc.Seed = 987654321
```
:::
:::{tab-item} CLI
```sh
k4run <steering-file> --UniqueIDGenSvc.Seed 987654321
```
:::
::::

## Using UniqueIDGenSvc in algorithms

To use the `UniqueIDGenSvc` in a Gaudi algorithm first include the header file and declare a member variable:

```cpp
#include <k4Interface/IUniqueIDGenSvc.h>

SmartIF<IUniqueIDGenSvc> m_service;
```

Then, initialize the service in:

```cpp
StatusCode ExampleAlgorithm::initialize() {
  m_service = service("UniqueIDGenSvc");
```

Then, use the service during execution:

```cpp
StatusCode ExampleAlgorithm::execute(const EventContext&) const {
  m_service->getUniqueID(1, 2, name());
}
```

## Seeding functional algorithm example

In the EDM4hep data model, the event number and run number can be obtained from an `EventHeaderCollection`.
The following is an example of a functional algorithm using `EventHeaderCollection` and `UniqueIDGenSvc` service to seed a PRNG.

To begin, some boilerplate code is needed to declare the `EventHeaderCollection` as an algorithm input. In this example, the algorithm will also generate and produce a `podio::UserDataCollection<double>` containing random numbers generated during its execution.
The name of input `EventHeaderCollection` object can be customized using the `EventHeaderCollection` property, with `EventHeader` set as the default name. Similarly, the name of the output `podio::UserDataCollection<double>`object can be adjusted via the `OutputCollection` property, which defaults to `RandomNumbers`.


```cpp
class ExampleRNGSeedingAlg final
    : public k4FWCore::Transformer<podio::UserDataCollection<double>(const edm4hep::EventHeaderCollection&)> {
public:
  ExampleRNGSeedingAlg(const std::string& name, ISvcLocator* svcLoc)
      : Transformer(name, svcLoc, {KeyValues("EventHeaderCollection", {"EventHeader"})},
                    {KeyValues("OutputCollection", {"RandomNumbers"})}) {}
```

Then, declare a member variable for the service interface and locate the service during algorithm initialization:

```cpp
private:
  SmartIF<IUniqueIDGenSvc> m_uniqueIDSvc{nullptr};

public:
  StatusCode initialize() final {
    m_uniqueIDSvc = service("UniqueIDGenSvc");
    if (!m_uniqueIDSvc) {
      error() << "Unable to locate the UniqueIDGenSvc" << endmsg;
      return StatusCode::FAILURE;
    }
    return StatusCode::SUCCESS;
  }
```

During algorithm execution the `EventHeaderCollection` can be used to obtain a unique value from the `UniqueIDSvc`, then the value can be used as a seed for PRNG. In this example the PRNG is then used to generate a random value and push it to an output collection.

```cpp
public:
  podio::UserDataCollection<double> operator()(const edm4hep::EventHeaderCollection& evtHeader) const final {
    const auto evt = evtHeader[0];

    // obtain  unique value
    auto uid = m_uniqueIDSvc->getUniqueID(evt.getEventNumber(), evt.getRunNumber(), name());

    // seed TRandom3 or some other PRNG of your choice
    auto prng = TRandom3(uid);

    auto coll = podio::UserDataCollection<double>();
    coll.push_back(a);
    return coll;
  }
```
