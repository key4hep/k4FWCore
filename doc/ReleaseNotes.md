# v01-03

* 2025-05-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#317](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/317))
  - Move the `DataHandle` and `MetaDataHandle` into the `k4FWCore` namespace to make origins more obvious
    - Keep deprecated `DataHandle` and `MetaDataHandle` aliases in global namespace for compatibility to allow for a smoother migration

* 2025-05-26 Thomas Madlener ([PR#321](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/321))
  - Remove the usage of `PodioDataSvc` from the `DataHandle` as it's not necessary
  - Harmonize the behavior of the constructors
  - Remove the declaration of the unimplemented default constructor

* 2025-05-21 jmcarcell ([PR#306](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/306))
  - Add a `--log-level` flag to `k4run` to make it possible to configure the log level at runtime via the command line
    - accpeted values are `verbose`, `debug`, `info`, `warning` and `error`
    - The log level will apply to the python logging facilities and will also be set in the `ApplicationMgr.OutputLevel`
  - Make the python logging a bit more informative by adding the log level as well as some module and function information to the message
  - Deprecate the `--verbose` option in favor of `--log-level=verbose`

* 2025-05-20 Thomas Madlener ([PR#320](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/320))
  - Remove the declaration of `DataHandle::getCollMetadataCellID` since the implementation has been removed long ago

* 2025-05-20 jmcarcell ([PR#315](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/315))
  - Bump the required version of podio. 1.3 is needed since https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/305 because of `edm4hep::DataTypes` and `edm4hep::LinkTypes`

* 2025-05-15 jmcarcell ([PR#313](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/313))
  - Use signal to stop immediately after receiving a SIGPIPE. Before, the output from k4run itself would always print and the pipe command (for example `| head`) would only be applied to the output from Gaudi.
  - Add a test that uses pipes

* 2025-05-13 jmcarcell ([PR#305](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/305))
  - Remove the hardcoded collections in the CollectionMerger, using https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/761. This applies to all collections that are available in EDM4hep.
  - Fix link collections that are currently not working since the data type name is not `edm4hep::...LinkCollection` but `podio::LinkCollection...`
  - Require a newer version of podio in the CMakeLists.txt

* 2025-05-05 jmcarcell ([PR#304](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/304))
  - Fix running algorithms with RNTuples as their input and add tests, not working before because the TTRee reader in podio was being used
  - Add two tests to create an rntuple and read it
  - Bump the required version of podio to 1.3 since the function `get_reader` in podio only has support for lists of files as an input after https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/729

* 2025-04-30 jmcarcell ([PR#307](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/307))

  - Replace `UniqueIDGenSvc` property `ThrowIfDuplicate` with `CheckDuplicates`. The service will cache ids and check duplicates only if `CheckDuplicates` is set to `true`. It's enabled by default for the Debug builds.

* 2025-03-05 Thomas Madlener ([PR#290](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/290))
  - Make the `PodioInput.collections`, `IOSvc.CollectionNames` and `Reader.InputCollections` properties actually work like expected. They now properly limit the collections that are read and no other collections will be available. **This requires building against podio > v1.2`**, otherwiset the current behavior will be used, where collections that are not requested will still be available.

* 2025-02-26 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#287](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/287))
  - Use the same event and run type in `UniqueIDGenSvc` as in `edm4hep::EventHeader`. Add generating id directly from `edm4hep::EventHeader`. **This changes the ID values !**

* 2025-02-25 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#293](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/293))
  - Fix typo in docs about migrating from `k4DataSvc`

# v01-02-00

* 2025-02-04 jmcarcell ([PR#282](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/282))
  - Use typeid instead of `EDM4hep::typeName` since not every EDM4hep type has `::typeName`.

* 2025-02-04 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#279](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/279))
  - Fix algorithm properties related to `eventNumber` and `runNumber` to deduce their type

  - Fix compilation warning about comparing integers with different signs, related to https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/398

* 2025-02-03 jmcarcell ([PR#275](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/275))
  - Make sure that the internal casts that happen for functional algorithms do not silently cast to wrong types.

* 2025-01-31 jmcarcell ([PR#277](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/277))
  - Use typeid to allow compiling functional algorithms that use Links

* 2025-01-31 Thomas Madlener ([PR#276](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/276))
  - Clean up the function that reads inputs in functional algorithms by defining an alias for the EDM4hep type and using that when possible. Remove `const` from this type and add it where needed.
  - Change `std::remove_cvref_t` to `std::remove_cv_t` since there the former is not needed.

* 2025-01-29 Thomas Madlener ([PR#273](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/273))
  - Make it possible to use `edm4hep::utils::ParticleIDMeta` with the `MetadataSvc`
    - Add template specializations for `get` and `put` that defer to the corresponding utility calls in EDM4hep
    - Add tests to ensure that metadata is indeed usable this way with the utilities in EDM4hep

  - Remove an unnecessary r-value reference qualifier for sinking the metadata Frame into the `MetadataSvc`.

* 2024-12-20 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#267](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/267))
  - Added documentation for reading and writing EDM4hep files with the `IOSvc`
  - Moved documentation on `k4DataSvc` to legacy page

* 2024-12-18 jmcarcell ([PR#264](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/264))
  - Writer: Ignore objects that are not collections in the store and write an output Frame
    - Add `const` where possible
    - Add `[[maybe_unused]]` to avoid a warning about not using the result of a `.release()` (the warning is correct in most cases, in this case it's the Gaudi store who owns it).
    - Remove some code in the Writer that is not necessary.

* 2024-12-10 jmcarcell ([PR#265](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/265))

* 2024-12-09 jmcarcell ([PR#262](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/262))
  - Write the configuration_metadata at initialize() in the Writer, to avoid having properties that are deleted because other algorithms are wrapped in a Sequencer and this Sequencer is deleted before `finalize()` is called for Writer.
  - Add tests for different combinations of old/functional algorithms and using PodioOutput or IOSvc and Writer.

* 2024-12-04 jmcarcell ([PR#261](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/261))
  - Add missing test dependencies

* 2024-11-28 Wouter Deconinck ([PR#257](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/257))

* 2024-11-01 jmcarcell ([PR#256](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/256))
  - Update service retrieval after deprecations in Gaudi v39.1, see https://gitlab.cern.ch/gaudi/Gaudi/-/merge_requests/1637
  - Throw when it's not possible to retrieve ApplicationMgr - it should not happen

* 2024-10-30 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#252](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/252))
  - Added thread-safe`EventCounter` algorithm

# v01-01-02

* 2024-10-29 jmcarcell ([PR#253](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/253))
  - Fix DataHandle::get() for non-collection types and remove dead code. A `reinterpret_cast` was changed to `static_cast` in https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/250 that made it fail at compile time for non-collection types. Now the `static_cast` is properly wrapped around an `if constexpr` and code around it has been deleted since it looked impossible to trigger.

* 2024-10-28 jmcarcell ([PR#254](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/254))
  - Don't add duplicated options for ToolSvcs

# v01-01-01

* 2024-10-28 jmcarcell ([PR#250](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/250))
  - Use `std::unique_ptr<podio::CollectionBase>` for the collections in the store instead of `std::shared_ptr<podio::CollectionBase>`. 
  - Fix leak in the `Writer` that otherwise would have been difficult to fix (without the change above)
  - Clean up `FunctionalUtils.h`: remove some unused overloads and change some names.

* 2024-10-17 jmcarcell ([PR#251](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/251))
  - Use size_t in the arguments for getting the input and output locations to remove warnings, and fix some comments

* 2024-10-15 jmcarcell ([PR#247](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/247))
  - Overhaul the `UniqueIDGenSvc`:
    - Use bit manipulation with the `UniqueIDGenSvc` which is about 1000 times faster than the string manipulation that was being done
    - Add a check for the case where an ID is repeated - trying to catch the case where the event number and run number is always the same, then the same random number sequence will be generated.

* 2024-10-09 jmcarcell ([PR#244](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/244))
  - Update README: remove note about GaudiAlg being outdated since it's not there anymore and Use Key4hep instead of Key4HEP

# v01-01-00

* 2024-10-03 jmcarcell ([PR#243](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/243))
  - Fix overwritting the input file for IOSvc from the command line. The k4FWCore wrapper of the ApplicationMgr checks the number of events (needed for multithreading) and if the file exists but this was happening right after the parsing of the file, without taking into account the input file can be overwritten from the command line.
  - Add a test where the input file is being overwritten from the command line

* 2024-10-01 jmcarcell ([PR#233](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/233))
  - Use podio::Reader and podio::Writer with IOSvc, so that it is easy to write TTrees or RNTuples by changing the `IOType` parameter given to `IOSvc` in the steering file.

* 2024-09-30 jmcarcell ([PR#242](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/242))
  - Add a docstring for the function that adds the arguments
  - Remove dead code, obvious comments and global variables
  - Use f-strings
  - Fix arguments when a property is a std::vector. Related to this fix now `k4run` will also display properties for which the default value is an empty list, previously these were not displayed.
  - Improve formatting of the message with all the values of all the properties

* 2024-09-29 Leonhard Reichenbach ([PR#207](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/207))
  - Ensure ROOT is in batch mode by setting `gROOT.SetBatch(True)` in `k4run`

* 2024-09-26 jmcarcell ([PR#236](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/236))
  - Add an argument for add_test_with_env not to have to repeat the test names
  - Also add some documentation for the function since it's getting complicated

* 2024-09-25 jmcarcell ([PR#239](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/239))
  - Fix histograms for Gaudi v39. After https://gitlab.cern.ch/gaudi/Gaudi/-/merge_requests/1586 the "old" histograms are renamed to  `StaticRootHistogram` from `RootHistogram`
  - Add a configurable histogram: `RootHistogram`, whose bins, title and other properties can be set from python as shown in the test file

* 2024-09-20 jmcarcell ([PR#237](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/237))
  - Assign to a const char* when using std::getenv

* 2024-09-17 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#223](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/223))

  - Fixed accessing input file metadata in MetadataSvc

* 2024-09-16 jmcarcell ([PR#234](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/234))
  - Add the possibility of starting from the Nth event instead of the first one with the argument `FirstEventEntry` to `IOSvc`.
  -  Add a test that ignores some events.

* 2024-09-12 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#224](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/224))
  - Fixed data race in `EventHeaderCreator` and make it ready for GaudiHive

* 2024-09-10 jmcarcell ([PR#235](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/235))
  - Use the Key4hepConfig flag to set the standard, compiler flags and rpath magic.

* 2024-09-05 jmcarcell ([PR#232](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/232))
  - Remove a few unused properties that do not exist anymore or belong to GaudiAlg which is not being built

* 2024-09-05 jmcarcell ([PR#213](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/213))
  - Fail if `IOSvc` or `ApplicationMgr` are not imported with `from k4FWCore import IOSvc` (it can be imported from `Configurables`). The python wrapper in k4FWCore does a few minor things and importing from `Configurables` doesn't fail currently and can lead to hard to solve issues.
  - Add an error message when reading a file without the `events` category. Currently it fails with an error in python that is not very clear.
  - Use `Input` and `Output` for IOSvc, deprecate `input` and `output` since all the other properties are capitalized. The same for `IOType` instead of `ioType`. This will print a warning about a duplicated property that should be ignored for now.
  - Suppress two warnings about using external input when using the default `EventLoopMgr`.
  - Import `ApplicationMgr` always from `k4FWCore`

* 2024-09-04 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#231](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/231))
  - Fixed missing checks for accessing metadata with `MetaDataHandle` when used with `IOSvc`

* 2024-09-02 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#228](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/228))
  - fixed virtual specifiers, removed redundant methods, uncluttered code

* 2024-08-26 jmcarcell ([PR#222](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/222))
  - Fix warnings when warnings are enabled. Warnings will be enabled later.

* 2024-08-23 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#227](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/227))
  - fixed typos
  - updated the usage example in readme

  - Use Links instead of Associations

* 2024-08-08 jmcarcell ([PR#215](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/215))
  - Add a metadata service that is automatically added when importing `IOSvc` from `k4FWCore`, if no metadata is added then the service won't do anything. If metadata is added, the metadata service will hold a `podio::Frame` with the metadata that the `Writer` will write. The metadata service only works when there is an output file.
  - Add a test showing an example of its usage
  - Make changes in the `MetadaHandle` to make it possible to save and read metadata from DataHandle-based algorithms, so that when switching to `IOSvc` metadata for existing DataHandle algorithms will keep working. Add a test using IOSvc with DataHandle algorithms that write and read metadata.

* 2024-08-07 jmcarcell ([PR#218](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/218))
  - Remove a few unnecessary includes

* 2024-07-30 tmadlener ([PR#217](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/217))

* 2024-06-05 tmadlener ([PR#195](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/195))
  - Make `MetaDataHandle::get` throw an exception in case the value for the handle is not (yet) available.
  - Add `MetaDataHandle::get(T defaultValue)` overload to get a default value and no exception in case the value is not (yet) available.
  - Add `MetaDataHandle::get_optional()` to retrieve an optional that is engaged and holds the value if the handle already has a value available.
    - The optional is returned directly from the underlying Frame in case that is available (see  [AIDASoft/podio#580](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/580)) or is constructed in place in case it is not yet available.

* 2024-05-29 jmcarcell ([PR#197](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/197))
  - Remove unnecessary messages (IOSvc saying at which entry we are when reading a file and an error message when a cast doesn't work, which is foreseen and will always happen when a functional algorithm reads something generated by the "old" algorithms), one of them an error message that is not an error
  - Fix tests by making a test throw instead of simply outputting an error message

* 2024-05-28 jmcarcell ([PR#198](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/198))

* 2024-05-21 jmcarcell ([PR#173](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/173))
  - Add a new way of using functionals in k4FWCore such that it's possible to run using the Gaudi HiveWhiteBoard (multithreaded) that includes:
  - A new service `IOSvc` to take of the input and output, together with a `Reader` and `Writer` algorithm, to be used instead of `PodioInput` and `PodioOutput`
  - Support for reading and writing an arbitrary (specified at runtime) number of collections, using `std::map<std::string, const Coll&>` for reading and  `std::map<std::string, Coll>`, i.e. for reading we get const references to the collections and for writing we put the collections using `std::move` typically in the map
  - Custom implementations of the Consumer, Producer and Transformer to make all of this possible and the interface simple (for example, if we have an algorithm that outputs a `std::map<std::string, edm4hep::MCParticleCollection>` we only have to set the names in python and all the collections will be in the store available for the next algorithms
  - Some utilities on the python side: automatic insertion of the Reader and Writer algorithms when an input or output files are specified, automatic creation of output folders (see https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/170)
  - Tests for several different situations: functionals reading and outputting to files, using only memory, running multithreaded, functionals with an arbitrary number of collections as input and/or output

* 2024-10-03 jmcarcell ([PR#243](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/243))
  - Fix overwritting the input file for IOSvc from the command line. The k4FWCore wrapper of the ApplicationMgr checks the number of events (needed for multithreading) and if the file exists but this was happening right after the parsing of the file, without taking into account the input file can be overwritten from the command line.
  - Add a test where the input file is being overwritten from the command line

* 2024-10-01 jmcarcell ([PR#233](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/233))

  - Remove a few unused properties that do not exist anymore or belong to GaudiAlg which is not being built

* 2024-09-05 jmcarcell ([PR#213](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/213))
  - Fail if `IOSvc` or `ApplicationMgr` are not imported with `from k4FWCore import IOSvc` (it can be imported from `Configurables`). The python wrapper in k4FWCore does a few minor things and importing from `Configurables` doesn't fail currently and can lead to hard to solve issues.
  - Add an error message when reading a file without the `events` category. Currently it fails with an error in python that is not very clear.
  - Use `Input` and `Output` for IOSvc, deprecate `input` and `output` since all the other properties are capitalized. The same for `IOType` instead of `ioType`. This will print a warning about a duplicated property that should be ignored for now.
  - Suppress two warnings about using external input when using the default `EventLoopMgr`.
  - Import `ApplicationMgr` always from `k4FWCore`

* 2024-09-04 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#231](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/231))
  - Fixed missing checks for accessing metadata with `MetaDataHandle` when used with `IOSvc`

  - Use Links instead of Associations

* 2024-08-08 jmcarcell ([PR#215](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/215))
  - Add a metadata service that is automatically added when importing `IOSvc` from `k4FWCore`, if no metadata is added then the service won't do anything. If metadata is added, the metadata service will hold a `podio::Frame` with the metadata that the `Writer` will write. The metadata service only works when there is an output file.
  - Add a test showing an example of its usage
  - Make changes in the `MetadaHandle` to make it possible to save and read metadata from DataHandle-based algorithms, so that when switching to `IOSvc` metadata for existing DataHandle algorithms will keep working. Add a test using IOSvc with DataHandle algorithms that write and read metadata.

* 2024-08-07 jmcarcell ([PR#218](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/218))

  - Make `MetaDataHandle::get` throw an exception in case the value for the handle is not (yet) available.
  - Add `MetaDataHandle::get(T defaultValue)` overload to get a default value and no exception in case the value is not (yet) available.
  - Add `MetaDataHandle::get_optional()` to retrieve an optional that is engaged and holds the value if the handle already has a value available.
    - The optional is returned directly from the underlying Frame in case that is available (see  [AIDASoft/podio#580](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/580)) or is constructed in place in case it is not yet available.

* 2024-05-29 jmcarcell ([PR#197](https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore/pull/197))
  - Remove unnecessary messages (IOSvc saying at which entry we are when reading a file and an error message when a cast doesn't work, which is foreseen and will always happen when a functional algorithm reads something generated by the "old" algorithms), one of them an error message that is not an error
  - Fix tests by making a test throw instead of simply outputting an error message
