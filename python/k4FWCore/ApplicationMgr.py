    - When running multithreaded and EvtMax is -1, set the number of events to
      be run to the number of events in the file so that no more events than

        obtain
        - The number of events in case EvtMax is set to -1
        - The collection names in case the CollectionNames are not provided

        Knowing the number of events is necessary to avoid errors when running
        multithreaded since if we have, for example, 10 events and we are
        running 9 at the same time, then (possibly) the first 9 complete and 9
        more are scheduled, out of which only one will be finished without
        errors. If we know the number of events in advance then we can just
        schedule those.

        We need the collection names to read to feed them to the Reader. Either
        we take the user provided ones or we get them from the first event in
