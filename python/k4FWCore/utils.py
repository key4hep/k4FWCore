    This function checks the given code for any imports of IOSvc or ApplicationMgr

    If IOSvc and ApplicationMgr are not imported from k4FWCore it's possible

    algorithms manually, which is done by the wrapper in k4FWCore. The checks
    are not comprehensive, it's still possible to import IOSvc or ApplicationMgr
    from Configurables.
