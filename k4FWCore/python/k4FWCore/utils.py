    This function checks the given code for any imports of IOSvc or ApplicationMgr
    from Configurables instead of k4FWCore. If such an import is found, an ImportError
    is raised.

    If IOSvc and ApplicationMgr are not imported from k4FWCore it's possible
    that k4run will fail, for example, by not adding the reader and writer
    algorithms manually, which is done by the wrapper in k4FWCore. The checks
    are not comprehensive, it's still possible to import IOSvc or ApplicationMgr
    from Configurables.

    Args:
        code (str): The code to check for wrong imports.

        ImportError: If the code contains an import of IOSvc or ApplicationMgr from Configurables.
