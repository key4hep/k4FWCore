    This function imports a module from a given filename, with the option to
    specify the module's name and inject global variables into the module before
    it is returned. If `module_name` is not provided, the filename is used as
    the module name after replacing '.' with '_'. Global variables can be passed
    as a dictionary to `global_vars`, which will be injected into the module's
    namespace.

    Args:
        filename (str): The path to the file from which to import the module.
        module_name (Optional[str]): The name to assign to the module. Defaults
            to None, in which case the filename is used as the module name.
        global_vars (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]): A dictionary of global variables
            to inject into the module's namespace. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Any: The imported module with the specified modifications.
